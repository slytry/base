# How to link to elements with ids
The main benefit of specific destinations is to link to locations in long files so your visitors don’t have to scroll through the file looking for the right section.

1. Find the location in the page where you’d like to create a landing spot. This can be any text on the page, but often is just a heading.
2. Choose an identifier name for the destination, like “coffee” or “summary” or “bio,” and insert an id attribute into the opening tag of the element.
3. Link to this ID with # sing. `<a href=www.vk.com#coffe`

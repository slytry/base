## Why we don't use absolute path everywhere?
- One problem is that URLs are hard to manage when you have a lot of them in a web page: theyâ€™re long, difficult to edit, and they make HTML more difficult to read (for you, the page author).
- if you have a site with nothing but URLs that link to local pages and you move the site or change its name, you have to go change all those URLs to reflect the new location.


Relative paths can only be used to link to pages within the same website, while URLs are typically used to link to other websites.

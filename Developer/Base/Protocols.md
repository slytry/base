## List
 - **HTTP **— is also known as the HyperText Transfer Protocol. In other words,
it’s an agreed-upon method (a protocol) for transferring hypertext
documents around the Web. While “hypertext documents” are usually
just HTML pages, the protocol can also be used to transfer images, or
any other file that a web page might need.
HTTP is a simple request and response protocol.

 - **FTP** — stands for File Transfer Protocol.
 
 - **File** — The file protocol is used when the browser is reading files right off your computer. For example, the file URL, “file:///chapter4/starbuzz/ index.html”, tells the browser that the file “index.html” is located at the path “/chapter4/starbuzz/”.
